`etcd-wrapper` configures and starts an embedded etcd.

In [gardener](https://github.com/gardener/gardener) context, each control plane (whether it is part of a seed or a shoot) gets its own etcd cluster.
An etcd cluster is realized as a [StatefulSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/).

Each etcd member is a two container `Pod` which consists of:
* `etcd-wrapper` which is the main etcd process.
* [etcd-backup-restore](https://github.com/gardener/etcd-backup-restore) sidecar which currently provides the following
  capabilities (the list is not comprehensive):
    * etcd DB validation.
    * Scheduled DB defragmentation.
    * Snapshotting - delta and full snapshots are taken at regularly.
    * Backup - delta and full snapshots are backed in an object store if one is configured.
    * Restoration - In case of a DB corruption for a single member cluster it helps in restoring from last full
      snapshot.
    * Member control operations e.g. adding the peer `etcd` process as a learner.


`etcd-wrapper` currently depends upon `backup-restore` sidecar container for the following:
* Validation of etcd DB
* Optionally restore the etcd DB from the backup object store in case the DB is corrupt (this is only relevant in a single node etcd cluster).
* Provide user provided etcd configuration.

To learn more about `etcd-wrapper` see `/docs` directory, please find the index [here](docs/README.md).

## Future improvements
* It is currently not possible to productively use `etcd-wrapper` without its sidecar([etcd-backup-restore](https://github.com/gardener/etcd-backup-restore)).
We intend to change this in the near future to make it possible to even productively consume `etcd-wrapper` independently.

## Feedback and Support
We always look forward to active community engagement.
Please report bugs or suggestions on how we can enhance `etcd-wrapper` on [Github Issues](https://github.com/gardener/etcd-wrapper/issues).
